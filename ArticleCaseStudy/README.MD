## Introduction
This is a DataCamp case study where different SQL operations are used to clean and analyse data. The  database has a table articles with a record 
of all articles published in the newspaper. However, the table will need some cleaning before the library can use it in the new system. 
The final results should be sorted from earliest published date to the most recent published date.

Below are the requirements the library has given to you for the data they need.
