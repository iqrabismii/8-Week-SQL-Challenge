Second, like Romney, Hubbard refuses to disclose critical information about his income, conflicts of interest, and paid advocacy activities. Third, both in public statements and in my personal experience, Hubbard has been evasive, misleading, and even dishonest when discussing both policy issues and his own conflicts of interest. And last but not least, those conflicts of interest are huge: Hubbard has long advocated policies that Wall Street loves, often without disclosing that he is, in fact, highly paid by Wall Street.</td>\n            <td>2012-10-27</td>\n            <td>glenn-hubbard-romney-campaign</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1754a5be-21f8-11ec-bdf6-acde48001122</td>\n            <td>WORLD NEWS</td>\n            <td>Death Toll In Romania Fire Rises To 41, Ex-Mayor Arrested</td>\n            <td>BUCHAREST, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Nine people died on Saturday from injuries sustained in a fire at a nightclub in Romania eight.</td>\n            <td>2015-11-07</td>\n            <td>romania-fire-kills-41-former-mayor-arrested</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1754a5fa-21f8-11ec-bdf6-acde48001122</td>\n            <td>PARENTING</td>\n            <td>Parents Really Do Want To Live Through Their Kids, Research Confirms</td>\n            <td>Countdown: History&#x27;s 12 Most Doting Dads Top 12 Warrior Moms in History 5 Ways to Foster Self-Compassion in Your Child Copyright.</td>\n            <td>2013-06-20</td>\n            <td>parents-live-through-their-kids</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1754a62c-21f8-11ec-bdf6-acde48001122</td>\n            <td>BUSINESS</td>\n            <td>10 States With The Weakest Unions: 24/7 Wall St.</td>\n            <td>24.7 Wall St.: Last year, the number of union members in the U.S. fell by more than 400,000, or 2.7%.

It was born out of a contradiction and a paradox. <br><br>The contradiction is that while the world is growing more interdependent, the media is fragmenting -- re-nationalizing, re-localizing and even tribalizing. The resulting paradox is that the information age is becoming the age of non-communication across boundaries -- political, cultural and ideological.<br><br>The aim of The WorldPost is to help bridge this growing chasm by becoming a platform where the whole world meets; a common zone where cross-pollination of ideas and perspectives from all corners of the planet can take place.<br><br>To achieve this aim, The WorldPost strives for a global viewpoint looking around, not a national perspective looking out. Along with intelligent curation of the global news and original reportage, what distinguishes us, above all, are the first person global voices of our contributors. Every week, they weigh in as events break from Havana to Beijing, from Moscow to Mexico City, Paris, New Delhi and Abuja among so many other places.<br><br>The WorldPost seems to have met an outstanding need. Thanks to you, one year later we have reached 28 million monthly views. We&#x27;ve shown that the message can catch up to the medium if we put our minds to it.
