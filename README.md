Solved on Postgres by implementing various SQL functions such as subqueries, CTE(common table expressions), correlated subqueries, nested subqueries, 
conditional statements like 'WHERE' statements, 
data aggregation using 'GROUP BY', windows function such as row_number(), rank(), dense_rank(), ordered data using 'ORDER BY',
used 'CASE WHEN' Statements, datetime manipulation, 
joined tables using inner or left join as per requirement.
A few cases required duplicate pre-processing, exploratory data analysis and summary statistics.
